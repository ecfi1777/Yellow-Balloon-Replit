STEP 1: Create the gallery data file

Create file: client/src/data/galleries.ts

Use our actual images from client/src/assets/generated_images/ folder. Here's the code:

export type GalleryImage = {
  src: string;
  alt?: string;
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
};

/**
 * Update these arrays with your actual image paths from client/src/assets/generated_images/
 */

export const mainGalleryImages: GalleryImage[] = [
  { src: "/assets/generated_images/First_haircut_salon_photo_93504202.png", alt: "Child getting their first haircut at The Yellow Balloon salon" },
  { src: "/assets/generated_images/Boy_haircut_salon_photo_f149f7c7.png", alt: "Young boy watching cartoons while getting a haircut" },
  { src: "/assets/generated_images/Toddler_first_haircut_photo_84ad34eb.png", alt: "Toddler's milestone first haircut" },
  { src: "/assets/generated_images/School_boy_haircut_photo_358e2981.png", alt: "School-age boy receiving professional haircut" },
  { src: "/assets/generated_images/Happy_children_haircut_results_7e382cdb.png", alt: "Happy children showing their new haircuts" },
  { src: "/assets/generated_images/Hair_braiding_salon_photo_81cddccf.png", alt: "Professional hair braiding and styling service" },
];

export const glamourPartyImages: GalleryImage[] = [
  { src: "/assets/generated_images/Glamour_party_styling_photo_1558caf6.png", alt: "Girl enjoying glamour party makeover with updo styling" },
  { src: "/assets/generated_images/Special_occasion_styling_photo_50692872.png", alt: "Special occasion hair styling with elaborate updo" },
  { src: "/assets/generated_images/Glamour_party_celebration_5e0f28c4.png", alt: "Glamour party celebration with kids getting styled" },
  { src: "/assets/generated_images/Group_glamour_party_photo_fc0c14de.png", alt: "Group glamour party with multiple children getting styling services" },
];

export const liceTreatmentImages: GalleryImage[] = [
  { src: "/assets/generated_images/yellow_balloon.png", alt: "The Yellow Balloon salon logo" },
  // Add actual lice treatment photos when available
];
