Task: Update the Glamour Parties page content. Keep the existing layout, components, and styling exactly the same. Only change text and add one new section as described.

Target route/file: The page rendered at /glamour-parties (e.g., pages/glamour-parties.* or the equivalent component).

1) ADD NEW SECTION (below “What’s Included” and above “Party Details & Pricing”)

Add a new section titled “Choose Your Glamour Style” using the same 3- or 4-column card/grid component already used on this page for feature boxes. Create three cards with the following copy (bulleted lists should render as simple bullets—no numbering):

Card 1 — The Fairy Princess

Hair Updo or Fancy Hairstyle

Polish fingernails

Theme decorations: balloons, cups & plates

Games

Music

Card 2 — The Pop Star

Funky updo with temporary color

Polish fingernails

Theme decorations: balloons, cups & plates

Games

Music

Card 3 — Hawaiian Luau

Hair braid with beads

Hawaiian flower clips

Polish fingernails

Theme decorations: balloons, cups & plates

Limbo

Games

Music

Keep spacing, fonts, and icons consistent with the site. If the component supports icons, use existing icon styles; otherwise text-only is fine.

2) EDIT EXISTING “Party Details & Pricing” BOX

Replace the current pricing text with:

Heading: Glamour Party Packages
Price line: $720 for up to 12 kids
Notes (bullets or small inline tags):

Each additional child: $55

Party times: Saturday or Sunday nights, 5:30 pm – 7:00 pm

Deposit: $150 non-refundable deposit required to reserve

Remove any references to “$35 per child,” “minimum 4 children required,” and keep the general “Includes” list and duration note if it still applies (1.5–2 hours is fine). Keep the “We provide all styling tools and accessories” line.

3) EDIT “How It Works” STEPS

Step 1 (Book Your Party): Remove “Minimum 4 children required.”
New text: “Call us to schedule your glamour party and reserve your date with a $150 deposit.”

Steps 2 and 3 stay the same.

4) KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE AS-IS

Header, “What’s Included,” CTA blocks, gallery, address, hours, and general “fun” copy remain unchanged.

Acceptance Criteria

New “Choose Your Glamour Style” section appears between “What’s Included” and “Party Details & Pricing,” matching the site’s existing card/grid styling.

Pricing box shows $720 up to 12 kids, $55 each additional, Sat/Sun 5:30–7:00 pm, and $150 deposit required.

No mentions of “$35 per child” or “minimum 4 children required” remain anywhere on the page.

“How It Works” Step 1 mentions the deposit; other steps unchanged.

No layout, spacing, typography, or color changes beyond the text updates and the one new section.
